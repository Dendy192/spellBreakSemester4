                    Spellbuild is a game of magic and sorceries and you need 
                    Mana to perform such magic. Players use magical gauntlets
                    to attack their enemies. Technically, you have unlimited
                    amount of Mana. But you must recharge your mana regularly.
                    You’re more vulnerable while recharging since you can’t cast
                    Spells, and enemies will try to attack you at that moment.
                    Try to time recharges when your character is behind cover
                    or moving quickly.

                    You can find gauntlets all around the map. Technically, 
                    players can cast an attack Spell without gauntlets, but
                    it’s weaker and has no additional buffs. There are 6 types
                    of gauntlets, all have special attributes and abilities to 
                    fight enemies. Gauntlets have five different rarities, from
                    Common to Legendary. Higher rarities do more damage and
                    cost less Mana. This is important because not only does it take
                    less Spells to defeat enemies, you can cast more before recharging.

                    This game is not only about who is more powerful than the other.
                    In certain situations, the more creative you are, the more
                    advatageous you get. This is because the game's mechanism that
                    allows you to combine multiple spells as your attack. For example,
                    you can combine the element of Toxin and Fire to create burning 
                    toxic gas that deals areal damage. Be creative with your combinations!
